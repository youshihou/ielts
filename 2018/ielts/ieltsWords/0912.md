write short, simple sentences:
don't use the passive voice unless you need to
put your subject at the start of the sentence
don't use relative clauses unless you really need to
// with who, which, that, where, etc.,
consider breaking longer sentences into shorter ones

use longer, more complex sentences only if you can't express your idea in a simpler way.
