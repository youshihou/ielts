it's a bit chilly.
it's freezing.
you can see your breath.
you'll need to bundle up.

it's drizzling at the moment.
it is only spitting.
suddenly, the heavens open.
it's chucking it down.
my clothes are getting soaked.

it's very overcast and dark overhead.
there's a storm brewing.
i can see lightning.
the wind picks up. it's almost a gale.

there isn't a cloud in the sky.
it is baking hot.
it's completely still.
it's a scorcher today.
it's boiling.


wintry

tomorrow will begin with a bit of frost on the ground.
it will be sleeting.
there will be a flurry of snow.
it will turn into a blizzard.
the snow will turn into slush.
it will be below freezing for most of the day.
