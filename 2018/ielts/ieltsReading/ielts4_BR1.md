When we receive your booking form and deposit, your reservation will be confirmed --- we wil send you a Booking Confirmation, together with advice on how to reach your holiday cottage and the telephone number of a local contact should you require further details on the cottage before leaving home.

Attached to the Booking Confirmation will be a note showing the balance due on your holiday and the date by which it is payable.

Outstanding balances on bookings made in the UK must be settled within 10 weeks of sending the deposit.


ARRIVAL
Please do not arrive at your holiday cottage before 3.30 p.m. or later than 7.00 p.m.

DEPARTURE
On the morning of departure, please leave your holiday property by 10 a.m. to allow caretakers sufficient time to prepare the property for the next visitors.

We ask that you please leave the property as you found it.

Please do not move the furniture as this can cause damage both to the furniture and to the property.


OVERSEAS BOOKING
We are delighted to take bookings from overseas visitors either by telephone or fax + 44 (0)1225890227. 

All payments should be made by credit card or by cheque in Pounds Sterling.

Please note that provisional bookings from overseas visitors will be held for 14 DAYS.

If the completed and signed booking form with the deposit is not received within that time, the reservation will be cancelled.



LAST-MINUTE BOOKINGS
If you wish to make a last-minute booking, please telephone the Holiday Booking Office to check availability.

If your reservation is made within 10 weeks of the holiday start date, full payment is due on booking.


ELECTRICITY
In most Wessex Cottages properties electricity must be paid for in addition to the holiday price.

You may be asked to take a meter reading at the conclusion of your holiday, or an additional fixed charge for electricity may be made.

Alternatively, there may be a coin meter, in which case you will be advised when you are making your booking.
 
In some cottages, electricity is included in the rental and in very few there is no electricity at all.




LINEN
In most Wessex Cottages properties you have the choice either of hiring linen, at a cost of Â£6.00 per person per week, or of bringing your own.

In some cottages linen is included and in a very few it is not available at all.

If you choose to hire linen, it will include bed linen (i.e. sheets and/or duvet covers and pillow cases), bath and hand towels and tea cloths but will not include towels for swimming or beach use.

Linen is not available for cots.

If you have any queries, do ask the Holiday Booking Office.
